# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Java programs I developed while learning key concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms. These projects demonstrate the implementation and understanding of fundamental data structures and their application in solving complex problems.

## About My Learning Journey

During my studies, I focused on understanding and implementing various data structures, including:

- **Array, ArrayList, and LinkedList:** Understanding the differences between these structures and their use cases for storing and manipulating data.
- **Stack and Queue:** Implementing and exploring the behaviors of these data structures for managing elements in a specific order.
- **Map and HashMap:** Learning how to efficiently store and retrieve data using key-value pairs.
- **Graph and Tree:** Implementing hierarchical structures for modeling relationships and connections between entities.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a reflection of my progress in mastering data structures and algorithms. These concepts form the foundation for building more advanced systems and solving real-world problems efficiently.
